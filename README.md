# Simple-Pong-Cpp
A pong game built using SDL and C++. The most recent version is available on the "Version-1.1-Refactor" branch.

# Master branch Changelog:



# 1.0
  8/27/19:
  
My approach to this project is to:
 1) Develop a working version - Acheived
 2) Make it easy to read and use good practices - In progress on separate branch
 3) Make it efficent
 4) Add features
 and repeat.
  
Simple-Pong-Cpp is my first working, event-driven game. It is basic, clocks in with around 350 LOC, and uses naive (but sometimes long) solutions. I built this game without much prior planning in order to get a better sense of the challenges with making event-driven games/graphical programs using SDL, and as such it isn't as readable as it should be. Consider this build as a mininmum-viable-product. 

To build the game, you'll need the SDL 2.0 graphics libary and the appropiate build options listed by Lazy Foo Productions on "http://lazyfoo.net/tutorials/SDL/01_hello_SDL/index.php".
