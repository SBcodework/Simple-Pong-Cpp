Simple-Pong-Cpp is my first working, event-driven game. It is basic, clocks in with around 350 LOC, and uses naive (but sometimes long) solutions. I built this game without much prior planning in order to get a better sense of the challenges with making event-driven games/graphical programs using SDL, and as such it isn't as readable as it should be. Consider this build as a mininmum-viable-product. 

Next steps: improve readability and restructure the project so that it is eaiser to understand. Do not add any features that noticablly modify the game experience.
